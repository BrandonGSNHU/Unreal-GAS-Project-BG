The following Demo project is almost at completion but utilizing Unreal Engines Gameplay Ability System, GAS, and the third person level I've been able to create the following:

1. Two atribute sets in Visual Studio using C++ to create values for stats such as Health, Damage, Stamina, Healing, and the maximum values for them.
2. I've created working abilities such as a dash, heal, and auto attack with functional icons, cooldowns, and effects.
3. I've created Health and Stamina bars as well as linked them to my attribute values for accurate updates. All values are clamped as to not go above or below minimum or maximum values.
.
I plan on creating a customer character, level, and adding AI to my enemy to showcase the full extent of my skills and I will update as those roll out.

Linked is a demo reel of my C++ code, my GAS project, and how I set it up.
