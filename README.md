The following Demo project is almost at completion but utilizing Unreal Engines Gameplay Ability System, GAS, and the third person level.
I plan on creating a customer character, level, and adding AI to my enemy to showcase the full extent of my skills and I will update as those roll out.

Linked is a demo reel of my C++ code, my GAS project, and how I set it up.
